            <p class="card-text"><b>President</b> -Mody Ndiaye is a humanitarian, a community organizer and an activist who likes to motivate and guide members to work together. He is a devoted servant of his community and believes that the commitment to serve the community gives us the opportunity to become active members of our community and has a lasting positive impact on society in general. He believes that if you do good to others and to the community, you will feel a natural sense of accomplishment and your role as a volunteer can only give you a sense of pride and identity.<br>
            Mody likes to organize young people in the community around sports activities like soccer. He believes that sports activities can not only help you live healthier lives by reducing diabetes and high blood pressure, but also that you meet people with whom you share moments of exchange and networking.
            He is co-host of the DMV Senegalese community radio (SA-DVM Radio Alias Radio MALICK), a fervent Pan-Africanist who believes that Africa can only be developed if it is united and fights the ills that plague the African continent especially the corruption of our leaders, unethical practices, bad governance, lack of organization and ignorance resulting from illiteracy. However, he strongly believes that this MUST begin with us, with our local community organizations that we lead. He believes that African leaders must first and foremost recognize that unity in Africa is in our interest and the only option for achieving peace, stability and economic development. Africa has not reached its rich potential and has the capacity to be autonomous and not to rely on foreign aid.
            Mody is a native of Dakar and lives in Maryland. He works as an IT Lead Senior Systems Engineer contracting with the Federal government.</p>

               He strongly believes that volunteering in community service does good for the community, but does so much for himself as an individual and a believer as well.
               According to Ben, volunteering is not only an act of giving his time and service to a cause without any payment, but also, a way of life that defines him.
               Ben is an Pan-African and Senegalese Outreach, and his bi-cultural background and focus on community collaboration has led him to a number of volunteer opportunities and
               community leadership roles where he would be coordinating volunteers, helping members and motivating others. He is an Entreprenor, a business and financial adviser, an event planner, a producer, a TV and radio host. He is a big fan of soccer, art and culture and his goal in life is to inspire others to serve and give back to their community, country and continent in any positive way they can. He always says that: "An objective diversity must be a source of strength, tolerance, solidarity, unity, and success, but absolutely not a source of division or separation which lead to any sort of failure"</p>
